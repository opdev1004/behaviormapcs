# 🥇 Behavior Map CS

Behavior Map is a simple state machine or state manager. Using Hash Table-like data structure to improve performance. And Behavior Map stores state(event) and behavior, for executing behavior during that state. Behavior Map does not make a huge difference from if statements. However, it can be more clean and reusable state management.
